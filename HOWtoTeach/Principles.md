#Principles of How to Teach

These principles come from a variety of sources but their utility in various discipline has made them perfect teaching tools. As a person passing knowledge, your primary concerns are with how to provide accurate information that will be retained and can later be used. You are creating memory functions if nothing else. These functions are ultimately designed for how individuals will interact with the world around them. 

As we have previously these systems are antithesis to "Rote Learning" or "Traditional" Education. As we have also mentioned a certain amount Rote is necessary to create a basic fluency required to use these methods. An outline of how to rote can be found at the bottom. 

Each one of these principles will be explained in greater detail during our next iteration of this document.

### Teaching to Principles / Design Patterns

Behind the majority of formal learning are basic principles that can be applied to the subject that is trying to be mastered. An explanation of the underlying principle should always be a primary concern during any instruction, training, or educating. Principles are powerful, because it is easier to handle exceptions to the principle than it is to teach each piece of learning as a separated chunk that needs to be consumed.

### Multiple Examples 

As you move through a piece of material you will want to mutate your Examples multiple times so that the principle can be seen. For whatever reason the human brain will often falter when only a single example is given.

### Provide extra working examples
Many times people will need to continue on past when a lecture or instruction. Make sure to leave lots of examples for people to use later so that they may see variations.

### Use Analogies
Analogies are a very powerful tool in teaching. They take an existing knowledge base that someone already has and leverage it into creating a new knowledge set. In programming this is called prototypal inheritance. Analogies in technical areas of study (STEM) are quintessential to being able to get through hard learning curves and to be able to amass a large knowledge base. They are also one of the most underused tools by bad teachers because they take an extra layer of abstraction to be able to accomplish.  

### Real Word Context/ Application / Utility

Real World Context is often the best teacher of all. In the documentation we will be going into depth about how to make the information that is offered practical in the real world. It is a very impactful technique. 

### Stories

Stories are in reality one of the two basis for all communication. Telling a REAL story to convey information is a fantastic technique for transferring information. It is also a key technique that memory competitors use. 

### History (explain where and how the thing came into existence)

Important Knowledge was generated at some time and place in history. Often the situation / environment from which the knowledge came from is useful for developing the neural network for which the imparted information will ultimately lie. There is always more to the story.

### Intermitten Recaps

Sporadic Repetition is great for reinforcing techniques, practices, and helps retain learned information. Be careful: DO NOT ROTE. 

### Using Multiple Media 

Human Beings aren't really built to stay hyper-focused on specific subjects for extended periods of time. To alleviate this, switching the media form to another type will often help refocus people. As an example: sticking a 10 min video between two 20 min lectures will help keep someone focused for 50 min straight.

### Senory Spikes

Utilizing different portions of the brain aids in the building of neural networks. To accomplish this engaging different human senses is a useful technique.

### Anchors / Using someones existing preferences

Anchoring information to something that someone already has an enjoyment of, much like analogies, will help impart information on that person.

### Reduction of complexity

Going through the process of reducing complexity can be a powerful teaching tool. Just don't forget to document your newly achieved reduction.

## Note: How to Rote

When rote learning cannot be avoided a "Spoon full of sugar" method should be used.
