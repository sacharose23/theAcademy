#MENTORSHIP  


“The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.”  

- William Arthur Ward  



## HUMILITY  

To be a great mentor is to be able to play both roles in life (the mentor and the mentee)...continue learning from your peers or superiors. Stay humble. You can learn a lot from your students.  



## INTEGRITY  

Following through...having integrity is a huge responsibility. Students depend on you. Stay committed. The Big Responsibility but the Rewards are Priceless.   



## EQUALITY  

No judgment. Your student can be anyone with different backgrounds and different learning capabilities.   



## TRUSTWORTHY

Believe in Your Student. Students should be able to let down their guard, share their insecurities, and feel welcome to ask “dumb” questions we all have sometimes.   



## PURSUER OF MASTERY    

Students and parents trust that you possess essential knowledge and will deliver with the highest quality. There is always room for improvement. Continue improving your skills. This is why Humility is essential to being the best you can be.     



## COMPASSIONATE  

Understanding that Students also have a lot on their plate when you are not around. Be sensitive to their personal & academic lives. Most of the time, their lack of improvement may be impacted by other things outside of tutoring.     



## LISTENER  

To give personalized sessions, you need to gather information from the student by listening. Take time to respond. No need to layout too much advice. Document the important takeaways. Help them sort through confusion.
  


## PATIENT  

Patience is vital especially when mentoring. You student will have moments of stress and you compassion will help you console him/her. Know how to give good constructive criticism. "How" you say something is just as important as "what" you say.    



## ROLE MODEL  

Remember your actions are constantly being assessed. Advice and wisdom is more powerful if you lead by example. 


	
	






## FIRST IMPRESSIONS  


### LISTEN:  

Welcoming greeting and small talk (student’s hobbies & interests, etc.)  

Student’s Goals   

Student’s Perspective of the test & his or her areas of strengths and weaknesses  


### TALK:  

In your experience…moment of enlightenment  

Discuss basics of each section...what skills & effort it will take...lessening their anxiety OR showing those underachievers what it’s REALLY going to take.  

Get a sense for student’s level of commitment...discuss scheduling and time management   
Reassure that you are on their team and will help in any way possible  



## Psychology Techniques to Battle Roadblocks  

### Motivation --   

People learn best from others who are likeable and respected. People will sometimes like other people that they themselves would like to be.   


### Reframing --   

Changing frame of reference. Most well documented in journalism, where it really got its roots. Zoom in and zoom out.   

Student can be very focused on the details.   
Bright student that’s hurting your potential by being negative.  
Let’s talk about how are you in comparison with other students all over the nation?
Our goal is to make you the best you can be.  

Syncing up with someone’s learning tempo. 
You want to make adjustments on your tempo to get them to your tempo but you need them to go at your tempo eventually.   

A student can seem impatient/nervous/uneasy/anxious.
You may feel like you need to fill as much information as possible within the time-framed attention span of a student. This is not good and once recognized should be a priority to fix.



### Change the Language --   



### Closing statement --   

It’s easy to read these techniques but it’s much harder to put it into practice. Like anything, you acquire these skills over time, mastering them as you go, improving upon your mistakes, and feeling rewarded when things do go your way. Learning from your peers is also necessary to become the best mentor. Observe other tutors in their element and engage in teach-backs.
