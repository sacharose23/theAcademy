Free resource for self-organizing groups to create the best education a kid can get K-12

## Synopsis

The aim of this project is to improve the primary education in the United States by open sourcing the curriculum, methods, means, and processes of education. Thus, this repository is a collection of resources that are designed to improve the quality of education in America by utilizing the spirit of open source software. 

## Core Principles of this Repository

We want to make education better through the spirit of open source software. 

Divergent thinking/ Creativity is an important aspect of education. 

We would like to provide a better future for students including: success in their chosen field, happiness of the individual, civic responsibility, and social responsibility 

We would like these resources to be as accessible as possible for all students and parents. Meaning money shouldn't get in the way of getting the best education in the world. 

We want people to be able to self organize and educate their children themselves. This resource will help make it easy to do that. Though we imagine this system to work best for a group of 30-40 students, it shouldn't restrict parents from implementing it 

## Application

Resources that are hands down the highest quality out there.

Feedback loop. More useful data on how to improve the resources. (and that doesn't mean more standardized tests) 

Iterative learning and teaching. 

Improving the Methods of teaching. 

Mentorship, real projects with real world effects, 

Getting Kids out of the sandbox and into the real world sooner and with better understanding of that world and better results. 

Education built for 2030 not for 1900. 


## Where our hypothesis originated

Rote learning should not be the basis of the education system.

Bureaucracy seems to inhibit progress in the education system.

Teacher performance is currently an issue. 

Money should have little to no bearing on getting a good education.

Creativity, and Entrepreneurship are discouraged in the current system.
