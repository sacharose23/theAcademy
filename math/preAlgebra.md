Guiding Principles aligned with The Academy

1. All students are different in their learning processes.
"Learning is not a linear process, so we must support non-linear exploration." (quotes below from website: www.virtualnerd.com/story)

2. Students must be guided & developed supplementally with strategies in how to learn...
"Students are often unable to identify the source of their confusion, so we must help them find what they need without forcing them to know what it is ahead of time."

3. Going back and reviewing old lessons is NOT to be discouraged.
"A solid foundation is critical for progression to more advanced topics, and when students find themselves struggling, it's often due to weakness in underlying concepts, so we must provide immediate and direct access to pre-requisite topics."

4. Students must be encouraged to go at their own pace.
"Quality matters in every aspect of every experience, so we must not cut corners."

5. Drop the Jargon/Nomenclature/Keep it Simple/Keep it Real
"When students are confused, they need to be able to focus on resolving their confusion, so we must not distract them with extraneous stimuli or with too much esthetic variation."

 #Ideas
People get really engaged with my lessons because prior to their interaction with me, they had some level of confusion with concepts of math. 
I believe it is this prior feeling that makes me successful in what I do.
It's the simplicity...the relief of overcoming that nagging bump in the road.

If a student works with me for a longer time period, they tend to view me as the primary source to learning everything math. The relationship is built and they admire me for it. 

Some students even end up enjoying math and developing a thirst for more. I find that this develops in students who are proud of themselves -- obsessed with the idea that they can stretch their potential and break through their personal boundaries.

My success is dependent on bad teachers. 

Hopefully...Eventually...this dependence will be obsolete. Then, we (tutors) won't be enough to engage an audience...We (tutors) will need to adapt to the "new" student...when a student first intercounters a math concept? They will be blank slates and WE need to capture their interest and create their thirst for knowledge.
