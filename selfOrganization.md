#Self Organization

##What does that mean?
theAcademy is built so that you can self organize education for your students. Now that we've said that. What the hell does it mean? Ideally you and a group of people will be able to take the resources provided and turn it into the best education that has ever existed for your kids. You'll act as a team, taking turns to teach your kids. We'll layout a schedule and the things you need to do so that you'll be able to make it work no matter what your situation (*notable exception are parents that don't care about their kids... but then why would you be reading this? send em to public school).

## Do you have to self organizize with a group?
Nope. it is completely up to you on how you use these resources.
We are writing this document and all of the resources that go with it to create a "crowd-sourced"-type approach to education. We understand that the resources are really good stuff and that home educators and professional educators might want to use it. Please Do! and please contribute to the project. The inspiration for theAcademy was just that we could do it better... if you can do it better than our hypothesis you are effectively.

##Why self organize a group?
Small groups have many advantages over other structures. They also have disadvantages. The reasons why we are recommending to use a small group approach are the following:

1) Small groups are fun! Think about the best party you have ever been to. It was probably centered around a small group of people.
2) You need at least a small group to learn/teach certain topics
3) Small groups help create autonomy for a student but let their social skill develop
4)
